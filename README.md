# Customer-Service
Using C++ implemented a shop simulator to handle customers.
Stored details of every customer in a queue.
Processed the customers to the cashier which will be available earliest.
To do this it calculates the time of arrival of customer, the time that will take to complete their request and also tracked previous customers to check if cashier is free at that time.
